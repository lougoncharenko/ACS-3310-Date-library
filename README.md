# ACS 3310 - Date Library

## Description

Dates are super important. You'll use them often. The goal of this assignment is to create a library that handles date operations in a better and more intuitive way than the built in Date Object.

## Why Do this assignment?

You'll make use the JS Date Object often. Building a library around dates will give you a better understanding of it works and what you can do with it.

## Project requirements

Your job is to make a class that wraps the Date object. Your class should have a Date it keeps internally. It should be able to instantiate itself with the same parameters that are used with the Date Object.

Your date library should inlcude unit tests for all of it's functions. Writing these as you work might be a good idea.
